## Instructions:

Before you start work on your assignment complete the following steps to get GitHub setup correctly. This is how you will share your work with your mentor and Code Apprentice.

1. Create a new repo in GitHub titled `family-tree`
1. Copy the url titled `quick setup` it should start with https:// This will be different for everyone and should should replace `{origin-from-your-github-repo}` with that link.

1. Copy and paste the following commands into your terminal.
	- `cd ~ && mkdir workspace`

### Directions

1. Create a JS file called `index.js`
2. Create 5 javascript objects that include family members and basic information about them as properties.
    - firstName
    - lastName
    - age
    - favoriteTVShow
    - favoriteSong

3. Put all familyMember objects into an array under the variable name family

4. Write a simple for loop that prints out the name and favoriteSong for each family member when the file loads initially.

5. Write a function that updates the favorite TVShow of the family member once a member of the family is passed in as a function parameter.

6. Update favoriteTVShow on all family members on page load. Print these new favorite shows out to the console.


*BONUS*

Write an additional function that reorders the family array by age of the familyMember

Once you have completed the code do the following:
 
1. Open a terminal
2. `cd ~/workspace/family-tree`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m 'finished the assignment'`
5. `git push origin master`
