# Code Apprentice - Assignment Week #4

## Assignment Title: state-flag

## Instructions:

Before you start work on your assignment complete the following steps to get GitHub setup correctly. This is how you will share your work with your mentor and Code Apprentice.

1. Create a new repo in GitHub titled `state-flag`
1. Copy the url titled `quick setup` it should start with https:// This will be different for everyone and should should replace `{origin-from-your-github-repo}` with that link.
1. Open a terminal
1. Copy and paste the following commands into your terminal.
	- `cd ~ && mkdir workspace`
	- `cd workspace && mkdir state-flag`
	- `cd state-flag`
	- `git init`
	- `git remote add origin {origin-from-your-github-repo}`
	- `git add .`
	- `git commit -m 'init commit'`
	- `git push origin master`

### Directions

You will generate an HTML/CSS document that displays your state flag. If your state flag has a complicated design you may use an image. (For example, it would be fine to use an image for the palmetto tree in the South Carolina flag)
- You must use CSS to position any elements, as well as style the flag the appropriate colors.
- You may also use CSS transitions to move the flag on the page.
- Example: [flags](https://pixelastic.github.io/css-flags/)

Once you have completed the code do the following:

1. Open a terminal
2. `cd ~/workspace/state-flag`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m 'finished the assignment'`
5. `git push origin master`
